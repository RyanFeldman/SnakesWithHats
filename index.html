				<h1>Welcome to a new age. An age of snake hats.</h1>
				<p>For far too long, snakes have slithered upon this earth hat-less. It is time for change. </p>
				<p>For years, humans have been afraid of snakes for absolutely no reason. Sure, some are venemous and could kill you in your sleep,
					but most are harmless. We cannot let the few evil snakes solely dictate our feelings toward a whole species.</p>
				<p>This is where hats come in. Look to the right. Tell me that snake doesn't look adorable. That's right, you can't. 
					Hats can give snakes the image boost they desperately need as they slither around us.</p>
				<h3>A New Era For Snakes</h3>
				<p>Did you know that ONLY 4% of all snakes are venemous? No? That's probably because it's blatantly made up.
					It's 25%. But that's still not THAT much. That means that 75% of snakes, the majority, have to suffer
					because of a small minority. </p>
				<h4>Summary of reasons snakes should wear hats</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>They look freaking awesome</li>
					<li>It will greatly increase snakes' self consciousness</li>
					<li>It will help overall attitude toward snakes</li>
				</ul>
