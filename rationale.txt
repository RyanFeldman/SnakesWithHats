	The target audience for Snakes With Hats is anybody who owns a snake, wants to own a snake, or deeply
cares about the intricacies snake perception and emotion. It was a promotional website trying to change 
the mind of those who don't put hats on their snakes. I chose a very neat, simple look for the site. I also
made sure to add in many pictures of snakes with hats on each page, to reinforce the main content of the site 
with the most influencial "argument". 
	The PHP aspects came into play when I made my contact form. Not only did I want email functionality, but 
I know many hatless-snakes activists will be angry with me, so they may send me horrible messages. Thus, I 
created a filter that changes any curse to asterisks, and calls them a filthy person if they use any. 

The WOW factor I wanted to go for is "Creative, entertaining content theme", especially from the Testimonials 
page. I took a long time phrasing and deciding on content for the site.
